I've made countless experiments with Sass in this project. If you will, I have a few points to note: the good sides, THE painful sides, and some difficult design decisions I took.

**Sass is awesome**. Alright, I said it. I somehow just ditched SASS for LESS last year. And then, recently, I just fell in love with Sass. One primary thing that made me turn my back from LESS is that it doesn't have a good `@import` globbing support (tho, I found the globbing plugin for useful). Bourbon / Neat are also awesome tools which life so ez.

**Sass Mixins are more awesome**.
