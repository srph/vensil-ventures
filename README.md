I've made countless experiments with Sass in this project. If you will, I have a few points to note: the good sides, THE painful sides, and some difficult design decisions I took.

**Sass is awesome**. Alright, I said it. I somehow just ditched SASS for LESS last year. And then, recently, I just fell in love with Sass. One primary thing that made me turn my back from LESS is that it doesn't have a good `@import` globbing support (tho, I found the globbing plugin for useful). Bourbon / Neat are also awesome tools which life so ez.

**Mixins > Reusable classes**. Mixins encouraged reusability while allowing flexibility. Reusable classes are bad because it's harder to track the styling of a selector. Building UI without a framework is an advisable way to survive CSS.

Besides expressing my love for mixin, I have also yet to shout how `extend` is likeable. I noticed how some components would be better off *extended* (`@extend`) instead of *included as a mixin* (`@include`. I've noticed that *flexible* mixins are pretty hard to maintain. Although, I've seen a good way from Bourbon / Neat to make mixins flexible; semantics are easier to play with compared to arguments.
